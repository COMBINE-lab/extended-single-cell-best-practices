# Data infrastructure

This chapter provides a short introduction to different data infrastructure tools that are widely used to store and share scRNA sequencing assays. We will introduce three databases and platforms here: the Gene Expression Omnibus, Figshare and Sfaira. 

In general, single-cell datasets are published in various data formats and we propose to keep records of the exact analysis steps to reproduce the published dataset. We added a separate chapter on *Reproducability* for exactly those matters. 

## Gene Expression Omnibus

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/

The Gene Expression Omnibus is a public data repository tailored to microarray, next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput functional genomics datasets. Researches can submit their data to this robust, versatile database and make it available for the community in an efficient way. Data submission is simple and supports various different formats for complete and well-annotated data. This data can be queried, located, reviewed and downloated by users.  

** TODO add GEO format figure?**
